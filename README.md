# DOGGOS AJAX PROJECT

## ABOUT
An hello world AJAX project inspired by the introduction to Web Development course by [Brian Holt](https://github.com/btholt).

The webpage sends API requests to the [dog.ceo](https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random) API. An API that returns random pictures of dogs.


## TASKS
    
1. Add this to your GitHub in its own repo (we'll learn how to do that later)
    
1. Style it nice using CSS.
    
1. Show a loading gif (just use an `<img />`) that shows when you're loading a new doggo and then hide it when you're done.
     <i class="fas fa-spinner fa-pulse"></i>
    
1. The dog.ceo API allows you to request a list of breeds. Use this list to populate a `<select></select>`. Then when a user select a dog breed, show a picture of that dog using the random image by breed API.
